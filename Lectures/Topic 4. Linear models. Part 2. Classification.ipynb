Let's consider a binary classification problem, and denote target classes to be \"+1\" (positive examples) and \"-1\" (negative examples). One of the simplest linear classifiers can be defined using regression as follows:\n\n$$\\Large a(\\textbf{x}) = \\text{sign}(\\textbf{w}^\\text{T}\\textbf x),$$\n\nwhere\n - $\\textbf{x}$ –  is a feature vector (along with identity);\n - $\\textbf{w}$ – is a vector of weights in the linear model (with bias $w_0$);\n - $\\text{sign}(\\bullet)$ – is the signum function that returns the sign of its argument;\n - $a(\\textbf{x})$ – is a classifier response for $\\textbf{x}$.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"5c87eadd81b17852517b0d279ae64307f7c4971f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.
