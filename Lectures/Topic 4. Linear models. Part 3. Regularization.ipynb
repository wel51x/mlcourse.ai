The model is also not sufficiently \"penalized\" for errors (i.e. in the function $J$, the sum of the squares of the weights \"outweighs\", and the error $\\mathcal{L}$ can be relatively large). In this case, the model will underfit as we saw in our first case.\n",
    "- on the contrary, if regularization is too weak i.e. the values of $C$ are large, a vector $w$ with high absolute value components can become the solution to the optimization problem. In this case, $\\mathcal{L}$ has a greater contribution to the optimized functional $J$. Loosely speaking, the model is too \"afraid\" to be mistaken on the objects from the training set and will therefore overfit as we saw in the third case.\n",
    "- logistic regression will not \"understand\" (or \"learn\") what value of $C$ to choose as it does with the weights $w$. That is to say, it can not be determined by solving the optimization problem in logistic regression. We have seen a similar situation before -- a decision tree can not \"learn\" what depth limit to choose during the training process. Therefore, $C$ is the a model hyperparameter that is tuned on cross-validation; so is the max_depth in a tree."

    "### Useful resources\n",
    "- Medium [\"story\"](https://medium.com/open-machine-learning-course/open-machine-learning-course-topic-4-linear-classification-and-regression-44a41b9b5220) based on this notebook\n",
    "- Main course [site](https://mlcourse.ai), [course repo](https://github.com/Yorko/mlcourse.ai), and YouTube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKTuw4PNOsU&list=PLVlY_7IJCMJeRfZ68eVfEcu-UcN9BbwiX)\n",
    "- Course materials as a [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/mlcourse)\n",
    "- If you read Russian: an [article](https://habrahabr.ru/company/ods/blog/323890/) on Habr.com with ~ the same material. And a [lecture](https://youtu.be/oTXGQ-_oqvI) on YouTube\n",
    "- A nice and concise overview of linear models is given in the book [\"Deep Learning\"](http://www.deeplearningbook.org) (I. Goodfellow, Y. Bengio, and A. Courville).\n",
    "- Linear models are covered practically in every ML book. We recommend \"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning\" (C. Bishop) and \"Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective\" (K. Murphy).\n",
    "- If you prefer a thorough overview of linear model from a statistician's viewpoint, then look at \"The elements of statistical learning\" (T. Hastie, R. Tibshirani, and J. Friedman).\n",
    "- The book \"Machine Learning in Action\" (P. Harrington) will walk you through implementations of classic ML algorithms in pure Python.\n",
    "- [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html) library. These guys work hard on writing really clear documentation.\n",
    "- Scipy 2017 [scikit-learn tutorial](https://github.com/amueller/scipy-2017-sklearn) by Alex Gramfort and Andreas Mueller.\n",
    "- One more [ML course](https://github.com/diefimov/MTH594_MachineLearning) with very good materials.\n",
    "- [Implementations](https://github.com/rushter/MLAlgorithms) of many ML algorithms. Search for linear regression and logistic regression.\n",
