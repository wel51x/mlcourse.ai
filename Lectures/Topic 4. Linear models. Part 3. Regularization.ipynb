The model is also not sufficiently \"penalized\" for errors (i.e. in the function $J$, the sum of the squares of the weights \"outweighs\", and the error $\\mathcal{L}$ can be relatively large). In this case, the model will underfit as we saw in our first case.\n- on the contrary, if regularization is too weak i.e. the values of $C$ are large, a vector $w$ with high absolute value components can become the solution to the optimization problem. In this case, $\\mathcal{L}$ has a greater contribution to the optimized functional $J$. Loosely speaking, the model is too \"afraid\" to be mistaken on the objects from the training set and will therefore overfit as we saw in the third case.\n- logistic regression will not \"understand\" (or \"learn\") what value of $C$ to choose as it does with the weights $w$. That is to say, it can not be determined by solving the optimization problem in logistic regression. We have seen a similar situation before -- a decision tree can not \"learn\" what depth limit to choose during the training process. Therefore, $C$ is the a model hyperparameter that is tuned on cross-validation; so is the max_depth in a tree."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"709869785b01d6d5bc52216174d65238ab53fe51"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Regularization parameter tuning**"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"711b18fc22b41fdb8a765d8a732faacf3ea0e4b6"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Using this example, let's identify the optimal value of the regularization parameter $C$.
